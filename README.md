# InsertionSort

Java program that uses insertion sort technique to sort a given array of integers.

In real world, arranging a set of unordered playing cards in hand relates to insertion sort. The plan is basically to arrange them in ascending/descending order based on the idea of picking each card and creating a division of sorted part and unsorted part until there are no cards left on the latter part.
